# NetworkManagerQt

Qt wrapper for NetworkManager DBus API.

This fork contains changes to build/install with qmake instead of cmake.

## Introduction

NetworkManagerQt provides access to all NetworkManager features
exposed on DBus. It allows you to manage your connections and control
your network devices and also provides a library for parsing connection
settings which are used in DBus communication.
